Violators, who do so, risk impoundment of the vehicle(s) and prosecution by the local police. These vehicles brought in by renters or visitors, with or without Las Conchas stickers, will be refused entry at the Guard Gate. Violators who bypass the Guard Gate do so at the risk of impoundment of the vehicle(s) and prosecution by the local police. The Association and the city of Puerto Pe√±asco enacted this ordinance to preserve the desert environment which was rapidly being destroyed by off road vehicles. At no time are any of these vehicles to be ridden on the beach side of Las Conchas (with the exception of the Las Conchas Guards patrolling the area and enforcing the rules).

            <!--<p>Effective January 31, 2008 United States and Canadian citizens 19 years of age and older, returning by land from Mexico will be required to show a government issued I.D. (drivers license) and a copy of their birth certificate. Children 18 and under must present a copy of their birth certificate. This is an interim change that will be in effect until June 2009 when all U.S. citizens will be required to present a valid U.S. Passport for re-entry into the U.S. For more detail on this and other foreign travel related information <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/whti-program-background/docs-land-sea" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>-->

Weekend return traffic Sunday (also Monday on 3 day weekends) can be moderate to heavy during peak hours (9:00 AM-5:00 PM) with delays occasionally well over an hour. Traffic wait time estimates are posted and updated hourly <a href="http://bwt.cbp.gov" target="_blank">on the internet</a>.

Get a few dollars off your Rocky Point vacation rental and spend what you saved on something exciting like your first scuba diving excursion. Mexico's Rocky Point has long been a spring break haven, but keep in mind there are other times of the year when a vacation rental in Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco can be found for a little less.</p>-->

Violators, who do so, risk impoundment of the vehicle(s) and prosecution by the local police. These vehicles brought in by renters or visitors, with or without Las Conchas stickers, will be refused entry at the Guard Gate. Violators who bypass the Guard Gate do so at the risk of impoundment of the vehicle(s) and prosecution by the local police. The Association and the city of Puerto Pe√±asco enacted this ordinance to preserve the desert environment which was rapidly being destroyed by off road vehicles. At no time are any of these vehicles to be ridden on the beach side of Las Conchas (with the exception of the Las Conchas Guards patrolling the area and enforcing the rules).

Get a few dollars off your Rocky Point vacation rental and spend what you saved on something exciting like your first scuba diving excursion. Mexico's Rocky Point has long been a spring break haven, but keep in mind there are other times of the year when a vacation rental in Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco can be found for a little less.</p>-->
